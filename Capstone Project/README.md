# Capstone Project - SQL Murder Mystery 🫆🔍 

## 📖 Project Overview

On **15 October 2025 at 9:00 PM**, the CEO of **TechNova Inc.** was found dead in their office.  
All clues related to the incident were hidden inside the company’s database, including:

- Employee details  
- Keycard entry logs  
- Call records  
- Alibi claims  
- Physical evidence  

As a **Lead Data Analyst**, my objective was to solve the case using end-to-end SQL investigation.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Determine **who** committed the crime  
- Identify **where & when** it happened  
- Understand **how** evidence matched the suspect  
- Use **only SQL queries** for the full investigation  
- Demonstrate analytical thinking through structured data analysis

## 🗂️ Datasets Used

| Table Name      | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `employees`     | Employee information |
| `keycard_logs`  | Entry/exit logs across office rooms |
| `calls`         | Call records with timestamps |
| `alibis`        | Employee claimed locations |
| `evidence`      | Evidence found at the scene |

Each table acted as a clue, and connecting them through SQL helped solve the mystery.

All SQL findings pointed to **one person**:

### 🔥 **Killer Identified: David Kumar (Employee ID 4)**

- Entered CEO Office during the murder time window  
- Provided a **false alibi**  
- Made a **suspicious call** minutes before death  
- Evidence matched his movement  
- Only suspect matching *all* clues
