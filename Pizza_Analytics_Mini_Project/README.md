# 🍕 IDC – Great Pizza Analytics Challenge  
### Mini Project | SQL Case Study | Indian Data Club

This repository contains my submission for the **Great Pizza Analytics Challenge**, part of the **#SQLWithIDC – 21 Day SQL Challenge** by **Indian Data Club**. The challenge focuses on analyzing real pizza sales data using SQL concepts learned up to Day 15.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze and explore pizza sales data using SQL and answer multiple analytical questions covering:

- Database creation & restoration  
- Filtering & logical conditions  
- Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY, HAVING)  
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, SELF JOIN)  
- Data cleaning using DISTINCT, COALESCE, NULL handling  
- Real-world style sales analysis

All final SQL queries were submitted in the required **CSV format** (one query per question).
